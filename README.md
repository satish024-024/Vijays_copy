🧠 Quantum Computing Fundamentals
What is Quantum Computing?Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that classical computers cannot efficiently solve. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition.

Key Quantum Concepts Covered in Our Project
1. Qubits and Quantum States- Qubit: The fundamental unit of quantum information
- Superposition: A qubit can be in state |0⟩ + |1⟩ simultaneously
- Bloch Sphere: 3D representation of qubit states using spherical coordinates
  - θ (Theta): Polar angle (0 to π)
  - φ (Phi): Azimuthal angle (0 to 2π)

2. Quantum Gates and Operations- Pauli Gates: X, Y, Z rotations (π rotations)
- Hadamard Gate (H): Creates superposition
- Phase Gates: P(θ) for phase rotations
- CNOT Gate: Two-qubit entanglement operation

3. Quantum Entanglement- Bell States: Maximally entangled two-qubit states
- EPR Pairs: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled pairs
- Quantum Correlation: Instantaneous state correlation between entangled particles

4. Quantum Measurement- Computational Basis: {|0⟩, |1⟩} measurement
- Probability Amplitudes: Complex coefficients determining measurement outcomes
- Born Rule: Probability = |amplitude|²
