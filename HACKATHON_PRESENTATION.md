**"Good [morning/afternoon] judges, mentors, and fellow innovators. I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to present Quantum Spark - our comprehensive quantum computing dashboard developed for the Amaravathi Quantum Hackathon 2025."**

#### **Section 1: Opening & Context (2 minutes)**
"Today, we're standing at the intersection of quantum physics and software engineering. Quantum computing promises to revolutionize everything from drug discovery to financial modeling, but accessing and understanding quantum systems remains challenging for most researchers and students."

**"Our mission with Quantum Spark is to democratize quantum computing by creating an intuitive, powerful dashboard that makes complex quantum operations accessible through beautiful, interactive visualizations."**

#### **Section 2: Quantum Computing Fundamentals (4 minutes)**
"Let me start with the basics that everyone in our team mastered:

**What is a Qubit?**
Unlike classical bits that are strictly 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in superposition - simultaneously being both 0 and 1. This is represented mathematically as:
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

**The Bloch Sphere**
We visualize qubit states on a 3D sphere where:
- North pole = |0⟩ state
- South pole = |1⟩ state
- Equator = superposition states
- Any point represents a valid quantum state"

**"Our dashboard brings this abstract mathematics to life with real-time 3D visualizations."**

#### **Section 3: The Problem We Solve (3 minutes)**
"**Current Challenges:**
1. Quantum researchers struggle with real-time job monitoring
2. Students can't visualize quantum concepts intuitively
3. No unified interface for quantum experiment management
