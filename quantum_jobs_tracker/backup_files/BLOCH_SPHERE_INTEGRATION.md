# Bloch Sphere Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration of the external bloch sphere simulator into the quantum dashboard. When users click the fullscreen button on the bloch sphere widget, it now displays the complete bloch sphere simulator from the `bloch-sphere-simulator-main` folder.

## Implementation Details

### Files Added
- `static/bloch-sphere-simulator/` - Complete copy of the bloch sphere simulator
- `test_bloch_integration.html` - Test page for verifying integration
- `test_bloch_integration.py` - Test server script

### Code Changes
- Modified `openBlochSphereFullscreen()` function in `hackathon_dashboard.js`
- Replaced custom bloch sphere implementation with iframe integration
- Simplified `setupFullscreenEvents()` to handle only exit functionality
- Removed unused functions: `initFullscreenBlochSphere()` and `setupFullscreenQuantumGateListeners()`

### How It Works
1. User clicks the fullscreen button on the bloch sphere widget
2. `openBlochSphereFullscreen()` creates a fullscreen container
3. An iframe loads `/static/bloch-sphere-simulator/index.html`
4. The external bloch sphere simulator runs with all its original functionality
5. User can interact with quantum gates, custom gates, and all features
6. Exit button allows returning to the dashboard

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Run the hackathon dashboard: `python run_hackathon_dashboard.py`
2. Add a bloch sphere widget to the dashboard
3. Click the fullscreen button on the bloch sphere widget
4. Verify the external simulator loads and functions correctly
5. Test quantum gates, custom gates, and all features
6. Exit fullscreen and return to dashboard

### Automated Testing
1. Run the test server: `python test_bloch_integration.py`
2. Open the test page in browser
3. Click "Test Iframe Integration" to verify loading
4. Click "Test Fullscreen Mode" to verify fullscreen functionality

## Benefits
- ✅ No code changes to the original bloch sphere simulator
- ✅ Full functionality preserved (quantum gates, custom gates, export, etc.)
- ✅ Clean integration with existing dashboard
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update
- ✅ No conflicts with existing bloch sphere implementations

```

## Usage
The integration is automatic. When users click the fullscreen button on any bloch sphere widget in the dashboard, they will see the complete external bloch sphere simulator with all its features intact.

## Troubleshooting
- If the iframe doesn't load, check that the simulator files are in `static/bloch-sphere-simulator/`
- If fullscreen doesn't work, ensure the browser supports the Fullscreen API
- For CORS issues, the test server includes proper headers
